# Railway Database

This repository holds the development of a Railway relational database, in order to implement an information system to a railway company. This relational database holds information about several entities like employees, passengers, stations, trains and their carriages, trips and each trip instance. 
For this work, we used SQL Server for data definition and manipulation, and Python to generate the datasets to insert in the tables. We also used Visual Basic for the UI.
